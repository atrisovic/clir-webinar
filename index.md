Open, reproducible and reliable research is critical for the scientific process. Although sharing the artifacts, data, code, documentation, and workflows associated with papers encourage scholars to turn a more careful eye to their own work, many challenges still remain, which will prevent other scientists from easily validating and building on prior work. This webinar consists of a keynote presentation and six lightning talks that will share to the community the preliminary results, effective standards and practices, experience, lessons learnt, as well as challenges and opportunities. The webinar is motivated partly by a 'reproducibility crisis' reported in some disciplines, and partly by the lack of software engineering training in academia, while the need to reuse research is quite high.

The prospective attendees of this webinar are researchers in computational data science, domain scientists, (data) librarians, data/repository managers, as well as other discipline and functional experts interested in reusable research or computational reproducibility. The overarching goal of this webinar is to discuss initiatives to conduct, track, remix, and share scholarsâ€™ daily computational research.
