# Description

Open, reproducible, and reliable research is critical for the scientific process. Although sharing data, code, documentation, and workflows associated with papers encourages scholars to turn a more careful eye to their work, many challenges remain, which will prevent other researchers from validating and building on prior work. This webinar will present relevant projects, approaches, and practices that advance research sharing for reproducibility and reuse. The overarching goal is to facilitate an exchange of ideas while discussing the current standards, challenges, and opportunities. 

The primary audience for this webinar is data scientists, researchers, data curators, managers of digital libraries and repositories. However, anyone interested in reusable research or computational reproducibility is welcome to join.
